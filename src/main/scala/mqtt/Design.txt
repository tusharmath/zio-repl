# MQTT Domain

- Models what the MQTT clients should do on every internal client event.

- Domain is built to solve a very specific set of problems.
- In this case the MQTT domain is supposed to configure the internal workings of the client.
  - Making sure the connection is done once
  - Making sure that connection is made in case publish happens before connection.
  - Making sure the connection is established only once.
  - Pre process messages for performance.

There are two options to do this

1. Use a ZIO based internal API

   - PRO

     1. Easily interop between ZIO and STM
     2. Easy to add various services

   - CON

     1. Too flexible
     2. Difficult to test

2. Create a MQTT domain

   - Extremely strict set of features
   - Will not allow any STM or ZIO or Service code.

   - Usage of state makes is a bit difficult

Issues in the current design

1. The concept of Init Update Command is too clunky
2. Update and Command are too specific to Mqtt.
